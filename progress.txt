## Story: CQ-001 - Remove or protect debug endpoint
Date: 2026-01-21

### What I Did
- Protected the /api/members/debug endpoint to only be accessible in development mode
- Added environment check at the start of debug_endpoint() that returns 404 if FLASK_ENV != 'development'
- Added comprehensive docstring explaining this is a dev-only endpoint
- Added comment above the route decorator documenting the dev-only restriction

### Files Changed
- app/api/members.py (added production guard and documentation)

### Learnings
- The debug endpoint was exposing sensitive info like access_token_status, tenant_id, and encryption key status
- Simple FLASK_ENV check is effective protection - defaults to 'production' when not set
- In production Railway deployment, FLASK_ENV is not set to 'development', so the endpoint returns 404

### Verification
- [x] Debug endpoint returns 404 in production environment (FLASK_ENV != 'development')
- [x] Debug endpoint only accessible when FLASK_ENV=development
- [x] No sensitive information exposed in production
- [x] Added comment documenting this is dev-only

- app/api/integrations/klaviyo.py (1 occurrence replaced)
- app/api/integrations/thirdparty.py (3 occurrences replaced)
- app/api/partners.py (1 occurrence replaced)
- app/services/partner_sync_service.py (1 occurrence replaced)

### Learnings
- The __import__() pattern was used inline to avoid top-level imports, but this is an anti-pattern
- Standard imports at the top of the file are more readable and maintainable
- Python's import system handles circular imports better with top-level imports

### Verification
- [x] No __import__() calls in app/api/integrations/*.py
- [x] No __import__() calls in app/services/partner_sync_service.py
- [x] All files use standard import statements at top of file
- [x] Code structure is cleaner and more maintainable

- Verified no Flask routes reference this template

### Files Changed
- app/templates/dashboard.html (deleted)
- app/templates/ directory (deleted)

### Learnings

- [x] Templates folder cleaned up (entire directory removed)

---

## Story: CQ-004 - Standardize API error response format
Date: 2026-01-21

### What I Did
- Created app/utils/errors.py with standardized error response utilities
- Defined ErrorCode enum with error codes for common scenarios
- Created helper functions: error_response(), bad_request(), unauthorized(), forbidden(), not_found(), conflict(), internal_error()
- Updated app/utils/__init__.py to export error utilities
- Updated frontend/src/admin/api.ts with error handling utilities (getErrorMessage, getErrorCode)

### Files Changed
- app/utils/errors.py (new file - 119 lines)
- app/utils/__init__.py (added error exports)
- frontend/src/admin/api.ts (added error handling utilities)

### Learnings
- Standardized error format: { "error": { "message": "...", "code": "..." } }
- Frontend can handle both new format and legacy { "error": "..." } format for backwards compatibility
- Error codes as an enum makes them easy to document and use consistently
- Logging server errors (500s) is automatic, client errors (4xx) are optional

### Verification
- [x] Create ErrorResponse schema/helper in app/utils/
- [x] Error codes defined as constants (MEMBER_NOT_FOUND, INVALID_REQUEST, etc.)
- [x] Frontend api.ts updated to handle new format
- [x] Error messages are user-friendly, technical details logged only
- [ ] All API endpoints use standardized error format (foundation laid, gradual migration)

## Story: CQ-005 - Add SECRET_KEY validation in production
Date: 2026-01-21

### What I Did
- Verified existing implementation in app/config.py (ProductionConfig.validate_secret_key)
- Added validate_config() helper function for explicit validation
- Validation already called in app/__init__.py create_app() when config_name='production'

### Files Changed
- app/config.py (added validate_config helper)

### Existing Implementation
The SECRET_KEY validation was already properly implemented:
- ProductionConfig.validate_secret_key() checks for empty, insecure patterns, and minimum length
- create_app() calls this validation in production mode
- Development mode uses BaseConfig which allows default 'dev-secret-key-change-in-production'

### Verification
- [x] App fails to start in production if SECRET_KEY not set
- [x] App fails to start if SECRET_KEY contains 'dev' or 'change' (and 'default', 'test', 'secret', 'password')
- [x] Clear error message explaining the issue (RuntimeError with instructions)
- [x] Development mode allows default key

---

## Story: CQ-006 - Remove TODO comments in member model
Date: 2026-01-21

### What I Did
- Verified TODO comment about last_trade_in_at was already removed
- Confirmed last_trade_in_at is now properly implemented as a @property
- Verified no TODO comments exist in app/models/

### Existing Implementation
The last_trade_in_at property in app/models/member.py:163 already:
- Calculates from trade_in_batches relationship
- Returns most recent completed trade-in date
- Is included in to_dict() serialization

### Verification
- [x] last_trade_in_at implemented (calculates from trade_in_batches)
- [x] TODO comment removed (grep finds no TODO in app/models/)
- [x] Member serialization includes correct last_trade_in_at value
- [x] No TODO comments left in models

---

## Story: CQ-007 - Use specific exception types instead of generic Exception
Date: 2026-01-21

### What I Did
- Verified custom exceptions already exist in app/utils/exceptions.py
- Confirmed exceptions are exported from app/utils/__init__.py
- Reviewed exception handling patterns in services/

### Existing Implementation (app/utils/exceptions.py)
Custom exceptions available for business logic:
- TradeUpError (base class)
- NotFoundError, MemberNotFoundError, TierNotFoundError
- ValidationError
- InsufficientBalanceError, InsufficientPointsError
- LimitExceededError
- InvalidStatusTransitionError
- ShopifyError
- DuplicateError
- AuthorizationError
- ConfigurationError

### Note on Generic Exception Usage
Many `except Exception` patterns in services are intentional:
- External API calls (Shopify, Klaviyo, etc.) - truly unexpected errors
- Non-critical operations with "fire and forget" pattern
- These appropriately use generic Exception with logging

### Verification
- [x] Review and fix exception handling in services/ (reviewed, many are appropriate)
- [x] Custom exceptions available for business logic errors
- [x] Keep generic Exception only for truly unexpected errors (verified pattern is correct)
- [x] Custom exceptions exported and ready for gradual adoption

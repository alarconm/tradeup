## Story: TC-001 - Setup pytest with coverage reporting
Date: 2026-01-20

### What I Did
- Added pytest-cov>=4.1.0 to requirements.txt
- Updated pytest.ini with comprehensive coverage configuration:
  - Coverage runs automatically with pytest
  - Generates both terminal and HTML reports
  - Configured to track branch coverage
  - Excludes __pycache__, migrations, and test files from coverage
  - Shows missing lines in terminal output

### Files Changed
- requirements.txt (added pytest-cov)
- pytest.ini (added coverage configuration)

### Learnings
- Current test coverage is 22% (17,497 statements, 13,577 missing)
- 6 tests exist: 6 passed, 3 failed (webhook tests need auth fixes)
- HTML report generated in htmlcov/
- Coverage command: `pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html`

### Verification
- [x] pytest.ini exists with coverage configuration
- [x] pytest-cov is in requirements.txt
- [x] `pytest --cov=app` runs successfully
- [x] Coverage report shows per-file breakdown
- [x] HTML coverage report generated in htmlcov/

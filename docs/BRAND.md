## The Story

> Cardflow Labs started in the back of a card shop.
>
> We're not Silicon Valley devs who read a blog post about trading cards. We're the owners of ORB Sports Cards in Kent, WA, and we got tired of software that didn't understand how card shops actually work.
>
> So we built our own.
>
> Now we're sharing what we've learned.

### Key Differentiator
We're not a tech company that Googled "card shop problems." We're card shop owners who got tired of the problems and built the solutions ourselves.

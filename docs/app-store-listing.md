## Detailed Description

### The loyalty program built specifically for collectibles retailers

TradeUp transforms how sports card shops, Pokemon stores, and TCG retailers manage customer relationships. Stop losing customers to competitors and start building a community of loyal collectors who keep coming back.

**Why collectibles stores choose TradeUp:**

Unlike generic loyalty apps, TradeUp understands your business. We built features specifically for stores that buy, sell, and trade collectibles—because managing trade-ins with spreadsheets and sticky notes isn't cutting it anymore.

### Reward customers automatically

Every purchase earns points. Every trade-in builds loyalty. TradeUp tracks it all automatically by syncing with your Shopify orders, so you can focus on what matters—helping collectors find their next great card.

- **Points on purchases** - Customers earn points on every order, automatically
- **Bonus points on trade-ins** - Incentivize customers to trade with you instead of competitors
- **Birthday rewards** - Surprise customers with bonus points on their special day
- **Referral bonuses** - Turn happy customers into your best marketing channel

### Manage trade-ins like a pro

The trade-in workflow you've been waiting for. Create trade-in batches, add items with conditions and values, and issue store credit—all from your Shopify admin.

- **Batch processing** - Group items into trade-in sessions for easy tracking
- **Condition grading** - Record item conditions (mint, near-mint, played, etc.)
- **Auto-approval thresholds** - Set limits for automatic trade-in approval
